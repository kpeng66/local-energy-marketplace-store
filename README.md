This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is the storefront for the Local Energy E-commerce platform, where stores with distributed generation (i.e. solar) can bundle their products with renewable energy credits to sell to consumers needing to reduce their carbon footprint. I built this project using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
